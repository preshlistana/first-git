# first-git

Trying to go through a github tutorial to test out how github works!
On my video with codetrain, I learned how I can create various branches. 
Branches are like different versions of a doc (1st draft, 2nd draft, 3rd draft)
Each branch, we can commit and choose to merge to our master draft using a pull request
A pull request shows all the different changes in the commited branches
