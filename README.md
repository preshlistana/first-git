# first-git

Trying to go through a github tutorial to test out how github works!
On my video with codetrain, I learned how I can create various branches.
Branches are like different versions of a doc (1st draft, 2nd draft, 3rd draft)
Each branch, we can commit and choose to merge to our master draft using a pull request
A pull request shows all the different changes in the commited branches
Backtracking, GitHub is a platform that hosts git which is a version control. Essentially,
GitHub stores the various changes of files and is great for collaborating.

A fork is used to create a duplicate of a repo from another account. Using forked repo,
users can create their own commits to the file and even send pull requests to the original
author/programmer. They can choose if they'll accept or not accept the pull request.
Users also have the option to leave comments to other users at the pull request page.

I created my own issue for coding train regarding his rainbow-poem. If they don't accept/deny
the request, then it will remain open. However, if they accept or deny it, it will be a closed
issue.

Now, I'm learning how to clone git repos & use my terminal to communicate with GitHub browser
and my laptop.
